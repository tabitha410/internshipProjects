By default, all sections are set to "true". If you wish to hide a specific section, set it to "false".

For the "book_cover_position" option, there are three available values: "top", "left", and "right". For example, if you set "book_cover_position=left", the book cover will be displayed on the left and the content will be displayed on the right."
